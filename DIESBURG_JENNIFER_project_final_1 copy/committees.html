            <section id="committees">
            <h2>ACC Approval</h2>
                <p>The goal of the Architectural Control Committee is to 
                    preserve the property values of all homeowners in Prairie Fields, 
                    and to ensure compliance with applicable covenants when a homeowner 
                    makes changes to their property. The Covenants for each phase of 
                    Prairie Fields specify that certain changes to your property require 
                    the approval of the Architectural Control Committee. This committee 
                    of residents within Prairie Fields will review proposed plans and grant 
                    approval to proceed. For now, this includes items like an addition to your home, 
                    building a deck, fence, or shed, or other substantial work which might a ect your neighbors</p>
                <p>Homeowners are required to submit plans for fences, decks, 
                    sheds or other outbuildings, additions, and other structures 
                    which require architectural approval to the architectural control 
                    committee. You may wish to review your Covenants for your particular 
                    home, before contacting the ACC.</p>
